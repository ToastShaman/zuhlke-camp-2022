# Threat Modelling

An Introduction by Kevin Denver

## What if?

Wouldnâ€™t it be better to find security issues before you write a line of code?

---

## Ways to find Security Issues

* Static Analysis
* Fuzzing
* Penetration Test
* Vulnerability Disclosures
* Bug Bounty Programe

---

## ..and Threat Modelling

* Think about security issues **early**!
* Understand your requirements better
* Prevent bugs before writing a single line of code

> Shift Left is a practice intended to find and prevent defects early in the software delivery process. [devopedia: Shift Left][10]

## What is Threat Modelling?

Threat modelling works to **identify**, **communicate** and **understand threats and mitigations** within the context of protecting something of **value**.

A threat model is a **structured representation** of all the information that affects the security of an application.

In essence, it is a view of the application and its environment through the **lens of security**.

---

## What does a Threat Model consist of?

A threat model typically includes:

* Description of the subject to be modelled
* Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
* Potential threats to the system
* Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
* A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

---

## When do you do a Threat Model?

Threat modelling is best applied **continuously** throughout a software development project!

Updating threat models is advisable after events such as:

* A new feature is released
* Security incident occurs
* Architectural or infrastructure changes

---

## How to Threat Model

1. What are you building?
1. What can go wrong?
1. What are you going to do about it?

---

## What are you building?

* Create a model of the system
  * Whiteboarding
  * Brainstorming
  * **Data Flow Diagrams** (preferred!)
* Focus on **Assets**: valuable things the business cares about
  * Something an attacker wants
  * Something you want to protect
  * A stepping stone?

> Use tools such as [Mermaid][6] or [pytm][5] rather than drawaing diagrams by hand

## What can go wrong?

* Fun to brainstorm
* Methodologies:
  * [STRIDE][9] (**S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation Disclosure, **D**enial of Service, **E**levation of Privileges)
    * Consider how each STRIDE threat could impact each part of the model!
    * [MITRE Att&ck][7] and [D3fend][8] can help if you get stuck
  * [Attack Trees][11]
* Structure helps get you to **completeness** and **predictability**
  * Need an engineering approach: Predictable, Reliable, Scalable
  * Can't be dependent on one brilliant person
