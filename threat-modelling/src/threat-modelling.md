# Threat Modelling

An Introduction by Kevin Denver

## What if?

Wouldnâ€™t it be better to find security issues before you write a line of code?

---

## Ways to find Security Issues

* Static Analysis
* Fuzzing
* Penetration Test
* Vulnerability Disclosures
* Bug Bounty Programe

---

## ..and Threat Modelling

* Think about security issues **early**!
* Understand your requirements better
* Prevent bugs before writing a single line of code

> Shift Left is a practice intended to find and prevent defects early in the software delivery process. [devopedia: Shift Left][10]

## What is Threat Modelling?

Threat modelling works to **identify**, **communicate** and **understand threats and mitigations** within the context of protecting something of **value**.

A threat model is a **structured representation** of all the information that affects the security of an application. In essence, it is a view of the application and its environment through the **lens of security**.

---

## What does a Threat Model consist of?

A threat model typically includes:

* Description of the subject to be modelled
* Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
* Potential threats to the system
* Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
* A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

---

## When do you do a Threat Model?

Threat modelling is best applied **continuously** throughout a software development project!

Updating threat models is advisable after events such as:

* A new feature is released
* Security incident occurs
* Architectural or infrastructure changes
